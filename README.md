## Features & Usage Guide

### User Authentication

- Register: Create an account and join a board.
- Login: Access your board and tasks.
---
### Board & Task Management
- Create Board: From the home page, create a new board for your team.
- Create Task: Add tasks, assign users, set priority and status.
- Edit/Delete Task: Update or remove tasks as needed.
- Drag & Drop: Move tasks between columns (To Do, In Progress, Done).

---
### Real-Time Collaboration
- All changes (task creation, updates, deletions) are instantly reflected for all users on the same board via **Socket.io**.
---

### Activity Log
- View a chronological log of all actions performed on the board.

---
### Smart Assign

- Assigns a new task to the user with the least active (To Do/In Progress) tasks, balancing workload automatically.

---
### Conflict Handling
- If two users edit the same task simultaneously, the app detects the conflict and prompts the user to Merge (combine descriptions) or Overwrite (replace with your changes).
---
### Smart Assign Logic
Implemented in getSmartUser:

- Fetches all users and their assigned tasks.
- Counts only active tasks (todo or in-progress).
- Returns the user with the fewest active tasks for assignment.

**Usage:**

When creating a task, click "Smart Assign" to auto-select the optimal user.

---
### Conflict Handling Logic
Implemented in editTask:

- When editing a task, the backend checks if the task was updated after the user's last fetch.
- If a conflict is detected:
  - The frontend displays a modal with options:
    - **Merge**: Combines both users' descriptions using resolveConflict.
    - **Overwrite**: Applies your changes, replacing the other user's edits.


- Ensures no data is lost and users are aware of concurrent modifications.
